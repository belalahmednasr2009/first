    <h1>History of programming languages</h1>
    <p>
      <u>The history of programming languages</u> spans from documentation of
      early mechanical computers to modern tools for software
      <b>development</b>.<br />
      <br />
      <u>Early programming</u> languages were highly specialized,<br />
      relying on mathematical notation and similarly obscure syntax.<br />
      <br /><u>[1] Throughout</u> the 20th <b> century,</b><br /><br />
      <u>research</u> in compiler theory led to the creation of high-level
      programming <b>languages,</b> <br />
      <u>which</u> use a more accessible syntax to communicate
      <b>instructions</b>.<br /><br />
      <u>The first</u> high-level programming language was <b>Plankalkül,</b
      ><br />
      <u>created</u> by Konrad Zuse between <b>1942 and 1945.</b> <br />
      <br />
      <u>[2] The first</u> high-level language to have an associated compiler
      was created by Corrado Böhm <b>in 1951,</b> <br />
      <u> for </u> his PhD thesis.<br />
      <br />
      <u>[3] The first</u> commercially available language was FORTRAN
      <b>(FORmula TRANslation),</b><br />
      <br />
      <u>developed</u> in 1956 (first manual appeared in 1956,<br />
      but first developed in 1954) by a team led by John Backus at <b>IBM</b>.

    <h1>Ada Lovelace: The First Computer Programmer</h1>
    <p>
      Ada Lovelace was the daughter of the noted poet Lord Byron and Annabella
      Milbanke Byron. Their marriage lasted little more than a year, and Ada
      never met her father. To counteract the "dangerous" mental tendencies of
      Ada's father, Annabella emphasized music, French, and mathematics in her
      daughter's studies. This last subject particularly appealed to Ada. In
      1833 Ada Lovelace met the mathematician Charles Babbage, who had designed
      a calculating machine called the Difference Engine. Lovelace was inspired
      by the prototype of the Difference Engine and became Babbage's lifelong
      friend. Babbage had a new project in mind, a much more-advanced machine,
      the Analytical Engine. In 1843 Lovelace translated a French paper that
      Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea wrote about the Analytical Engine.
      She also added thousands of words of her own notes to the paper. Lovelace
      realized that the Analytical Engine could carry out an extensive sequence
      of mathematical operations. The example she wrote of one such sequence—how
      to calculate Bernoulli numbers—is regarded by computer historians as the
      first computer program. She even speculated that the Analytical Engine
      could be used to perform operations on "other things besides number," such
      as musical notes. Only a small piece of the Analytical Engine was ever
      built, and Ada Lovelace died in 1852. Her fame lives on, however. She gave
      her name to the Ada programming language. Every year on the second Tuesday
      in October, the contributions of women to science, technology,
      engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are celebrated on Ada Lovelace Day.
